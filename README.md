 K-Means clustering 
- K means means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (cluster centers or cluster centroid), serving as a prototype of the cluster. 

 Hierarchical clustering
 - Hierarchical clustering, also known as hierarchical cluster analysis, is an algorithm that groups similar objects into groups called clusters
 
 DB Scan clustering
 - DBSCAN algorithm is Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise. Well, there are three particular words that we need to focus on from the name. They are density, clustering, and noise.
